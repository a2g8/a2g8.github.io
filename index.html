    <h2>IT Technologies</h2>
    
    <h3>Cloud Technology</h3>
    
    <h4>Definition of Cloud Technology</h4>
    <p>Cloud computing means users can access the applications, software, database, networking, analytics, and  artificial intelligence via the internet which leverages on cloud technology 1. </p>
    
    <h4>State of the Art of Cloud</h4>
    <p>The applications and services offered by cloud, add value hugely to the person or organisation using it. They include:
    	- Software as a Service (SaaS)
    	- Users can access the applications or software hosted by the cloud-provider-server via the internet.
    	- Platform as a Services (PaaS) provides infrastructure, operating system, development tools required to develop applications.
    	- PaaS allows customers to focus on the core functions of building an app such as build, test, deploy run, update and scale applications without having to build their own platform.
    	- Infrastructure as a Services (IaaS) provides IT infrastructure including providing users access to servers, storage and networking or access to the back-end of IT infrastructure.</p>
    
    <h4>Technology that Makes Cloud Technology Possible</h4>
    <p>Virtualisation is possible because of hypervisor technology. Hypervisor technology is the backbone of virtualisation. Hypervisor technology allows the creation of multiple virtual machines on top of the virtualisation layer. A virtual machine is operating independent of the physical server, and other virtual machines. As such if the virtual machine is corrupt, infected with a virus, or hacked, it will not have any effect on the host or other virtual machines. Thus allows for the physical data centre resources to be provisioned amongst the many users.</p>
    
    <h4>Benefits of Cloud Computing</h4>
    <p>In the past, servers were used and maintained on-the-premise. A company has to invest in both physical space, hardware, network and people to create and maintain their own servers which are expensive and time consuming to build.  Cloud computing reduces these costs and can be provisioned (increased or decreased) quickly.</p>
    <p>In general on-premise servers are often idle as such is a waste. Cloud computing reduces this cost drastically. With the advancement of cloud computing, third-party providers build and manage their own servers and then charge fees in providing cloud services (SaaS, PaaS and IaaS).  This enables companies to focus on the main core functions of their business and innovate faster. The I.T infrastructure requirements can be provisioned (increased or decreased) very quickly and paid on a needs basis (pay as you go). There is no up-front cost and no ongoing commitment.</p>
    
    <h4>Data Centre</h4>
    <p>Cloud technology requires state-of-art data centres. Google Data Centre is one of them. 
    	Google’s data centre is a building with powerful computers used to run its services. It allows data to be stored, managed, and disseminated. Its data centre has customised infrastructure such as power stations, cooling systems, physical security and a support team that works 24/7 to resolve any issues. One building can house 75,000 machines which can provide a bandwidth of one petabit per second (which is more than the entire internet) to allow high performance and low latency. The private network is growing at a faster rate than the internet-facing network as to allow connectivity between data centres which allows efficient access to resources at its different location.</p>
    
    <h4>Future cloud technology will revolutionise the usage of the following technologies</h4>
    
    <h5>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h5>
    <p>AI and ML requires large investments in infrastructure and expert programmers. Cloud technology makes the technology cost effective and economically viable.</p>
    
    <h5>Serverless Cloud</h5>
    <p>The term “serverless” which still uses servers refers to when the cloud dynamically allocates resources and charges only for computing and storage needed to execute the piece of code.  The team that writes and deploys the code does not have to manage nor provision the servers as this is taken care entirely by the provider. By combining the execution of codes to a larger processing pipeline such as an application that is running on conventional servers, cost is reduced. The technology that makes this possible is containers with Kubernetes being the popular choice for a platform to manage serverless infrastructure.</p>
    
    <h5>Cloud Virtual and Augmented reality</h5>
    <p>Virtual reality is defined as a replacement of a real-life environment with a simulated one whereas augmented reality is defined as adding digital elements to a real live.
    	Both VR and AR require costly resources such as powerful graphic hardware and compute resources.
		Installing the required resources in the servers & using cloud technology via the internet, users can now use VR and AR at a fraction of the cost where they were required to purchase these resources themselves. This made the technology economically viable.
		Latency is an issue and the technology requires 5G technology for stable streaming.</p>
	
	<h5> Internet of Things</h5>
	<p>IDC survey predicted that there will be 80 billion connected devices by 2025. IoT will become an interconnected to cloud technology.</p>
	
	<h4>Impacts</h4>
	<p>Spending on Clouds is expected to exceed 45% out of IT budget by 2026 – a material increase from 17% in 2021 (Gartner 2021)</p>
	
	<h4>AI and ML</h4>
	<p>Machine learning algorithms are now made available on clouds. They are available from computing platforms such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud or IBM Cloud will be important.</p>
	
	<h4>Serverless Cloud</h4>
	<p>The real benefit that comes from using  serverless cloud is the cost savings. Instead of having the application sitting on a server which would be idle most of the time, the serverless cloud that executes codes are event-triggered that can be combined within a larger app that sits on a server. This will reduce overheads and costs. Therefore, future jobs will require professionals to understand serverless cloud, its benefits and disadvantages, and being able to integrate serverless cloud as part of a wider application or pipeline.</p>
	
	<h4>Internet of Things</h4>
	<p>Future IT professionals will need to understand how to implement cloud technology with the internet of things so as to ensure high performance and low latency associated with processing information in distant servers instead of locally.</p>
	
	<h4>VR and AR</h4>
	<p>VR and AR can be used for gaming, providing 3D representations on how furniture would look like in a given space, providing a “how-to-repair-guideline” to technicians, architectural virtual home design, providing fire fighters with training simulations. As such there is a widespread use of the technology. Professionals that want to specialise in this technology will need to understand both VR, AR and cloud technology as a whole.</p>
	<p>Overall new technology will reduce and make older traditional jobs redundant and create new jobs that are creating value in the marketplace. Traditional jobs that involve maintaining on-premise servers will diminish. Jobs that can utilise the latest cloud technology will increase and grow in demand.</p>
	
	<h4>How Technology Will Affect You?</h4>
	<p>Most of us are already cloud technology users without realising it. Like anything else, cloud technology and its applications are tools which can bring positive or negative outcomes.</p>
	<p>We use social media to connect with friends such as Telegram, Whatsapp, Instagram, facebook and many more. It can bring a positive outcome where I am more than ever connected to family overseas. However, it can also bring negative outcomes such as social disengagement. For example: A student has seen two people sitting at a table inside a café or restaurant. Instead of having a meaningful conversation they were both texting, glued to their mobile phones, and were in their own world.</p>
	<p>Studying a Bachelor of IT at RMIT via Open Uni that is conducted online makes learning possible especially for those who cannot attend a classroom because of work or family commitments. This will undoubtedly enhance both knowledge and productivity of the student in the future.</p>
	<p>Cloud technologies can also be leveraged with mobile apps to make payments or if someone is running a business they can collect payments from customers using a mobile phone and a card reader.</p>
	<p>As new technologies are created, the older generation may not keep up to date and fall behind.  They may find technology difficult and this can create a sense of frustration. For example: An elderly man who had difficulty understanding the internet, but with vigorous determination, the person was able to now use the internet for browsing and various things and he now loves viewing videos on Tik Tok.  It is just like anything else that with a determined effort, a barrier to an obstacle such as using and understanding technology can be overcome.</p>

	<h3>Cyber Security</h3>	
	<p>The term "Cyber Security" refers to a group of techniques, tools, and procedures that work together to defend computer systems, networks, and data from hacker assaults and illegal access. Protecting all organisational assets against external and internal threats as well as interruptions brought on by natural catastrophes is the primary goal of Cyber Security.</p>
	<p>The “state of the art” in Cyber Security basically means the latest and most powerful software we have for services to protect companies from cyber harms and threats. It assists in avoiding financial loss, defends against ransomware, other forms of malware and virus threats. It prevents data from being stolen, hacked or otherwise compromised. Cyber Security avoids hardware damage that can reduce productivity.</p>
	<p>There are many different streams in Cyber Security and here is the list of them:
		* Critical infrastructure security
		* Application security
		* Network security
		* Cloud security
		* Internet of Things (IoT) security</p>
	<p>In order to keep the systems strong, organisations must use more than three of the Cyber Security streams up above to protect the organisation itself.</p>
	<p>The "state of the art" in IT security offers specific guidance and suggestions for taking action. With the help of these recommendations, businesses and providers will do better to determine what is "state of the art" in terms of IT security regulations.</p>
	<p>The “art of cyber security” is that it’s just going to get better day by day. There is always space to fill something out, and in the world of Cyber Security it can be advanced and improved. Here are some things on  what to do now in Cyber Security:</p>
		<p>- Enforcing Password Rules - Rules like creating your password with more than ten words including special characters (!,?,$,&,@), using a mix of capital letters, fusing numbers and finally making a rule where you cannot use your last 10 previous passwords as your password.</p>
		<p>- Using VPN - Your online data transmission is concealed by a VPN connection, which also shields it from snoopers. Anyone with network access and the desire to examine it can access unencrypted data. Hackers and online criminals are unable to decode this data when using a VPN.</p>
		<p>- Update System Regularly - Updates can enhance compatibility and programme functionality while preventing security flaws. Software updates are necessary to maintain the functionality of computers, mobile devices, and tablets. They also may reduce security vulnerabilities. Identity theft, hacking, and data breaches have all made the news recently.</p>
	<p>Cloud encryption is a fantastic cybersecurity tool for protecting data, according to experts. Cloud encryption can stop unauthorised users from accessing data that is useful. Additionally, cloud encryption can increase consumer confidence in cloud services and make it simpler for businesses to adhere to legal requirements.</p>
	<p>In the field of cyber security it is very hard to predict what is going to happen in the next couple years. It will be depending on the type of threats we receive in the IT world. In the coming years we will see very similar cyber attacks that we have seen in the past. As study’s show, the Cyber Security field is unlikely to slow down within the next couple years as it’s still in demand. </p>
	<h4>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
	<p>With the technology evolution and the digital revolution around people, all businesses, corporations, organisations and governments are relying on computerised systems to manage their day-to-day activities through the internet. Cyber security impacts us globally through cyber-attacks and threats because we share important information online and through its impact, private and important information and data might easily get leaked. </p>
	<p>In this situation, the impacts vary.  People would suffer personal and financial information losses due to cyber-attacks through emails and texts or websites. As for the governments, the important and classified information would be exposed and cause catastrophic consequences. As for businesses, there are four common impacts that should be considered when suffering from a data breach.  </p>
	<p>Financial losses- 
		- Loss of money: small businesses can go bankrupt by paying a ransom against a cyber-attack; for large corporations, the ransom may run into the millions. Extra and extended costs are needed in terms of operational disruption.
		- Leaking of corporate information.
		- Leaking financial information may include information related to your bank and payment card.
		- Operation and trading can go disrupted.  
		- The loss in business or losing contracts </p>
	<p>Theft- 
		While cyber attackers may threaten large corporations for a good ransom, smaller businesses are typically less sophisticated and easier to penetrate. Although attackers can make money from cyber fraud, stolen data can be worth more especially when sold on the Dark Web.</p>
	<p>Reputational damage- 
		- Loss of trust from customers 
		- Loss of sales
		- Reduction in profits</p>
	<p>Fines-
		If the data is accidentally or deliberately compromised and breached and if it is against data protection and privacy laws, and you may face fines and regulatory sanctions because you have failed to use the security measures.  </p>
	<p>Cyber threats never stop. There are millions being created every year and continue to grow and evolve more complicated which poses a growing number of trends and potential threats that should be monitored, regardless of individual or size or industry of businesses.
		- Remote working cybersecurity risks
		- The Internet of Things (IoT) risks
		- The rise of ransomware
		- Increase in cloud services and cloud security threats
		- Social engineering attacks 
		- Multi-factor authentication risks
		- Rise of Automotive Hacking
		- Potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
		- Mobile devices risks
		- Data breaches
		- Human error</p>
	<p>Cyber security is a fast-moving sector, and especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, it has accelerated the digitalisation of many organisations, coped with remote working and created more and more potential risks in terms of cyber threats. Along with the development of technology and the increasing importance of cyber security to an organisation’s critical infrastructure, the demand for talent in this is at an all-time high and likely to remain unfilled.  </p>
	<h4>How will this affect you in your daily life? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>
	<p>In today’s digital age we are constantly dependent on the internet and technology by using various electronic devices and the internet to share and exchange information in our daily lives. It has made our life easier than before. However, it also leaves us vulnerable to risk because all our data relating to security, health, personal, and financial information can be stored online which is a necessary component of our life. Therefore, cyber security is a top priority and affects our daily/working lives greatly. </p>
	<p>The threats of cyber-attacks or cyber crimes affect our lives day by day. Here are some cybercrimes:
		1.     Email and internet fraud
		2.     Identity fraud (where personal information is stolen and used)
		3.     Theft of financial or card payment data
		4.     Theft and sale of corporate information 
		5.     Cyber extraction (demanding money to prevent threatening attacks)
		6.     Ransomware attack (a kind of cyber extraction)
		7.     Hacking a computer or device
		8.     Data loss by entering the system illegally
		9.     Data theft 
		10.  Various other malicious attacks and network hacking etc.  </p>
	<p>People who are attacked or fall into a trap by malicious hackers then not only do you suffer financial loss but their personal important and sensitive information will be breached and exposed online or sold to others. Furthermore, people’s lives would be endangered.</p>
	<p>Personal information and data breaches are the most annoying to our daily lives. You often get anonymous calls and text messages from familiar corporations day by day that you think are reliable and then you actually fall for it and it is already too late before you even realise it.  </p>
	<p>Moreover, your friends' and family's personal contact information would be at risk of being exposed if your personal information is breached. Aside from this, the mental issues such as stress and anxiety and fear would increase greatly.  </p>
