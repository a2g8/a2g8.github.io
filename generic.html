									<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
									<p>The Guru’s Guide to The Great Ocean Road will initially be a web-based directory of some of the wonderful things that this beautiful part of the world has to offer. Some of the things that will be displayed on the website will be some of the great scenery that can be seen, amazing hike or bike riding trails in the area, some of the amazing places to eat great food, and some of the fantastic cultural locations that the area has to provide. 
 
										This guide will then be evolved from a web-based solution to an application, which will be provided to both iOS and Android users. The application version will give users the option, based on their current location, to search for any of the amazing things that the Great Ocean Road has to offer.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Motivation</h3>

									<p>The Great Ocean Guru’s absolutely love this part of Eastern Australia and would love to be able to share this passion with the world, especially those looking to travel in this area of our beautiful country. Being able to quickly look at a map and choose an amazing hiking trail or decide to visit a fantastic art exhibit being held nearby would be such an amazing tool for anyone in the area.</p>
									<p>Whilst we do acknowledge that websites like Trip Advisor already currently exist, we feel that our website, and eventually app, differs because we do not feel that every location needs to be allocated a spot on our list based on a rating. Rather than only showing the top 3 hiking trails through this area, we want to show users all the hiking trails available, limited only by the area on the map they are searching.</p>
									<p>Our motivation is not just to share some great locations from this beautiful part of our country, however. We also want to use this as a great chance to expand on our current skill sets and branch out into new skill sets, such as app design, as a group.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>

									<p>The Guru’s Guide to the Great Ocean Road is a website, which will have categories, to highlight some of the most beautiful locations of the area surrounding the titular Great Ocean Road. The most basic form that this will take is a website that has a list of locations that we believe are being missed by the vast majority of people who travel through this region of Victoria. 
										The broad categories that will be highlighted will include nature trails for hiking or riding on including some amazing scenery which can be viewed along. Cultural exhibits such as art galleries, museums, and natural cultural icons provide fantastic places to explore. Fantastic places to eat, whether its local cafes or restaurants, small patisseries and local go to spots will be available for the foodies travelling.</p>
									<p>For the nature lovers, the plan is to highlight some of the fantastic trails that are available to walkers. These will be highlighted by showing users the starting location of the trails, and the general route that will be taken. Alongside information based on the length of the walk, and the general difficulty involved to ensure that all users can find a trail that suits both their tastes but also their abilities. There will also be information about some of the amazing places to stop and rest to admire the beauty, such as hidden lakes or rock formations and look out points to give the avid photographers some great spots to provide some inspiration.</p>
									<p>The Great Ocean Road has some fantastic cultural locations along it. Museum lovers will be overjoyed at the range of options available to them. Locations such as the Australian National Surfing Museum, The Great Ocean Road Story and George Taylor’s Vintage and Rare Motorcycle Collection are but a handful of the options available to explore. Art lovers will not be disappointed either with locations such as the Warrnambool Art Gallery or spots like the Ngatanwarr Mural there to excite and inspire them. There also exists some natural focused locations like the Volcanoes Discovery Centre in Penshurst, which visitors can visit for interactive displays that show the geology and history of volcanoes in the Greater Hamilton Area.</p>
									<p>Food is something that everyone needs, great food is something that everyone loves. The Guru’s guide will provide a rundown of all the food locations in town, from little hole in the wall coffee shops, all the way up to the fine dining restaurants which can be found all over the Great Ocean Road. To ensure you do not get lost on your way to these locations, there will also be a map to show you where it is.</p>
									<p>The application is the second iteration of the website, and as such is the end goal for this project. All the above will be included on the app, however instead of being a web-based list, we hope for this to be an interactive map. By opening the application, you can search in the area around you if your phone's location is turned on. Once you have selected the location you wish to visit it will then also provide you directions to get you there. Alternatively, you can search along the route you are taking to see what amazing places you can visit during your travels.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Tools and Technology</h3>

									<p>The first piece of technology that we intend to use during this project is GitHub. GitHub provides such a fantastic platform for all the creators to interact with, and work on the project at a time and place that is convenient to them. It allows all the creators to conduct all their individual work, without needing to continuously synchronise at regular intervals, and helps ensure that everyone is working off the most up to date version.h</p>
									<p>The second most important tool needed will be a html editing program. Examples of these include Atom, Notepad ++, Visual Studio Code (VSC) and Sublime Text. The creators are not picking a particular application to use, as everyone has their own preferences and it seemed counter-productive to enforce that choice.</p>
									<p>The final tool required, specifically for the second iteration of this project, will be an application creation tool. Examples of these include MIT Application Inventor, Quixy, AppyPie or iBuild App. We have not yet settled on which application we plan to utilise yet, as we plan to create and launch the website prior to beginning the work on the application iteration of this project.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Skills Required</h3>

									<p>The first skill that will be required is a level of proficiency with HTML code writing. This will make up the bulk of the work needed for the first iteration of our project. HTML writing will be used throughout this project to ensure all the content is present on the page, and additional pages are set up correctly.</p>
									<p>Secondly, HTML CSS skills will be utilised in conjunction with the standard HTML writing to ensure that the website is visually appealing, because whilst ensuring that all the content is available on our site, if it is not visually appealing, users may decide against utilising our service. 
									Communication is an important skill when in any group project. Many people overlook soft skills, however being able to effectively communicate and collaborate on this project will be essential in ensuring deadlines are met or ensuring that the content is set out in a consistent manner.</p>
									<p>App design is an entirely different skill set when compared to HTML based web design. As such, depending on the software we decide to use to begin the application will then direct which skill sets will need to be learnt to complete the second iteration of this project. It will however revolve around things such as being proficient in a programming language, some form of User Interface (UI) design and back-end computer.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Outcome</h3>
									<p>There are two levels of success for this project. The first level is the successful completion of a website which will house a list of some fantastic areas around the Great Ocean Road that tourists and locals alike use to search for some of the fantastic trails, views, eateries, cultural exhibits, and other exciting attractions that this beautiful area has to offer.</p>
									<p>The second level of success would be the successful creation, and distribution, of an application which will allow users to view these locations on an interactive map, which will allow them to filter what they are searching for and then provide them directions from their current location. 
									There is no major problem that this website and application is solving, it is not here to revolutionise the way in which humanity will live its life or anything grand. This website and application will be here to hopefully bring to light some of the beautiful places that exist around The Great Ocean Road and expose it to more people around the country and around the world.</p>
